# Visual Studio Code Plugins

## Currently Evaluating

* [VSCode Eval](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=expixel.vscode-eval) - Evaluate multiple selections as javascript expressions and replace them with their values.
* [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.
