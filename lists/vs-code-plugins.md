# Visual Studio Code Plugins

* REST Client - This is great for making curl web requests straight from VS Code ** Highly recommended **
* Todo+ - Really simple and easy to use todo tracker with easy keyboard shortcuts and simple time tracking baked in.
* Bracket Pair Colorizer 2 - It's a developer must have!!!
* Azure Functions - Dev and Deploy Azure functions easily without leaving VSCode!
* Docker - Manage your containers without commands (although I do prefer portainer - see my tools list)
* Powershell
